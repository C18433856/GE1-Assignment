# Description of the project

My project will simulate the experience of being abducted by an UFO. An UFO will appear in the sky and chase the player until the player is directly under the UFO, then a beam will be sent down which will immobilize the player and slowly pull them upwards into the ship. The player will enter the ship and they will be able to look around inside it.

# How it works

I plan to design the UFO and the inside of it using ProBuilder. I would like the UFO to feature sounds effects and various blinking lights. I plan to get free sound effects from the internet to use for this project, or I may make my own if I can't find something that suits. The beam shooting down from the UFO and pulling up the player will be implemented using either a conical or cylindrical game object which will be rendered transparent, and which will stretch along the y axis until it reaches the ground. Once the player is in contact with this object, the pulling upwards motion will be initiated by slowly increasing the player's position on the y axis. Once the player is inside the UFO, they can observe the interior and interact with certain parts.
